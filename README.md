# Grid-based CSS Framework

This is our solution to Microverse's eighth project. It is a Grid-based CSS Framework which can be found as 'framework.css' inside the css directory. To apply it, we cloned The Odin Project home page which can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The clone was created using HTML5 and CSS3, while the framework was built using CSS3.

A live version can be found [here](https://raw.githack.com/eduardoreisalvarenga/CSS_Framework/home_page/index.html).
